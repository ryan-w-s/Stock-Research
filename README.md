# Stock-Research
Helper to streamline stock research

Opens up a variety of websites relating to a provided stock symbol.

Some of the tabs opened require an account to work properly, but all of them are accessable for free as far as I know.

Intended to be used as a custom search engine, set it up in your Chrome settings [like so](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/03/30/custom-search-engines-in-google-chrome/).

The pattern you will want to use is `[url]/goto.html&stock=%s`

There may be a UI page in the future for searching the stock before opening research tabs (hence, renewTickers.py) but no interest currently.
